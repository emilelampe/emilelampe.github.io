### Speech-based Automatic Personality Recognition

Developed a complete ML pipeline for speech-based Automatic Personality Recognition on novel databases for spontaneous and scripted speech. The spontaneous speech database was part of a larger project, where my team and I had people have conversations with a digital avatar connected to GPT-3.

### [The European Refugee Crisis in data over time](https://github.com/emilelampe/european-refugee-crisis-visualization/)

A project with two collaborators aimed at better visualizing data regarding the European Refugee Crisis, as numbers stated in newspapers often don't appeal to imagination. By scrolling the mousewheel, you move through time, changing the arrows on the map according to how frequent certain refugee routes were used. The stacked bar chart shows the refugees' country of origin, while the crosses at the bottom represent the known number of deaths from people trying to cross the Mediaterranean Sea.

### Multi-label Stratified Group Splits

A tool that can split multi-label data while maintaining group-independency amongst the splits and stratifying the data. Included are functions to split data into a training and test set, to create k folds for cross validation, and to output a graph showing the multi-label stratification of the created training and test set.

### You Need A Budget - Splitwise Connect

Connects personal finance app You Need A Budget with cost-sharing app Splitwise. 
Reduces manually uploading and keeping track of shared transactions in both apps to only marking transactions as ‘shared’ once in YNAB.
