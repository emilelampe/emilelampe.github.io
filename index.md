### Speech-based Automatic Personality Recognition

Developed a complete ML pipeline for speech-based Automatic Personality Recognition on novel databases for spontaneous and scripted speech. The spontaneous speech database was part of a larger project, where my team and I had people have conversations with a digital avatar connected to GPT-3.

### The European Refugee Crisis in data through time

The European Refugee Crisis visualization project is an interactive website that offers a human-centric perspective on refugee migration through time. It features a map of Europe and Africa displaying refugee routes, a stacked bar chart representing the number of refugees and their countries of origin, and crosses symbolizing lives lost during the Mediterranean crossing, all created using D3.js for data-driven visualizations.

### Multi-label Stratified Group Splits

A tool that can split multi-label data while maintaining group-independency amongst the splits and stratifying the data. Included are functions to split data into a training and test set, to create k folds for cross validation, and to output a graph showing the multi-label stratification of the created training and test set.
